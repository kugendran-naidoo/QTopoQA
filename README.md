# QTopoQA
QTopoQA - Quantum Topological Protein Complex Interface QA. Quantum paper for PhD in progress.

QTopoQA is an experimental research codebase that explores topological data analysis (TDA) and quantum-inspired operators to assess the quality of protein complex interfaces (Interface QA / EMA).
The project aims to combine persistent homology & graph learning (GNN) with quantum-native constructions of the boundary operator to study when topological signals improve ranking and error detection in predicted complexes.

Repo structure (as of now): datasets/, qtdaqa/, scripts/, topoqa/, topoqa_train/ plus .gitignore and README.md.
